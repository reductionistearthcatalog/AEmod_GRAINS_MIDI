# AEmod_GRAINS_MIDI
Modifications of firmwares for the Tangible Waves AE Modular GRAINS module. Along with a hardware modification which adds an input patch point to the serial Rx pin of the microcontroller, enables compatibility with the Wonkystuff MB-1 MIDI interface.

wavegrains:
A2 (CV in 1/knob 1): wavetable select knob (keep switch in manual position, this acts as an offset for the wavetable select parameter)
A1: (CV in 2/knob 2): wavetable select CV (keep switch in "in 2" position, knob acts as an attenuator for incoming wavetable select CV)
A0: (knob 3): sweep knob (knob acts as an offset for incoming sweep CV)
A3: (CV in 3): sweep CV

trishape:
A2 (CV in 1/knob 1): Hard sync knob (keep switch in manual position, this acts as an offset for the HS parameter)
A1: (CV in 2/knob 2): Hard sync CV (keep switch in "in 2" position, knob acts as an attenuator for incoming HS CV)
A0: (knob 3): wrap knob (knob acts as an offset for incoming wrap CV)
A3: (CV in 3): wrap CV

scheveningen:
A2 (CV in 1/knob 1): follower osc pitch knob (keep switch in manual position, this acts as an offset for the follower parameter)
A1: (CV in 2/knob 2): HS CV (keep switch in "in 2" position, knob acts as an attenuator for incoming follower CV)
A0: (knob 3): wrap knob (knob acts as an offset for incoming wrap CV)
A3: (CV in 3): wrap CV
